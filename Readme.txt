Aseprite to Unity allows you to save time importing those awesome pixel art animations your artists have spent hours creating!

It's actually pretty simple to use. First, make sure your artists have followed standard practices for creating their animations.
This includes: 

	- saving all animations loops for the same object in .ase file
	- all .ase files can be found under a single folder
	- hiding layers that should not be visible in the final sprite
	- (optional) setting loop types in Aseprite for animations that do not loop
